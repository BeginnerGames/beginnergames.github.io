        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have been developing a game of mine for the past two years now. 
            I got in to game development when I was 13 and I have been very passionate about it. 
            I'm creating assets to help fellow developers kickstart their projects and learn new things along the way. 
            This process is also a great opportunity for me to expand my skills and knowledge. By sharing my work, I hope to contribute to the community and make game development more accessible to everyone.
        </p>
